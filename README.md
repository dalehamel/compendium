# Work in progress

This is a work in progress for a free, open source knowledge base on computer systems.

I intend to add to this as I expand my knowledge of computer systems.

In particular, this will cover:

* Basic computing theory
* How a processor works
* Internals of a computer system
* Basics of networking
* Operating system function
* System administration
* Fundamentals of data centers, cloud computing

The goal of this publication is to demystify the inner workings of computer systems, and to be a valuable resource for anyone interested in entering the field of computer science, particularly to system administratiors and systems specialists.
